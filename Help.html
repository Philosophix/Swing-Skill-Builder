        <h1>Swing Skill Builder Help</h1>
        
        <p>Swing Skill Builder can generate more than 10.000.000 different training tasks!</p>
        
        <p>It is based on the philosophy, that playing better golf is more a matter of skill than technique. This does not imply that technique is irrelevant in the noble quest of getting better at golf. What it does imply, is that skill is a bigger factor in the equation as the numerous different successfull swings on the professional golf tours amply demonstrate.</p>
        
        <p>Swing Skill Builder was developed to help you sharpen your golf skills and get better at golf. When using one of the harder difficulty levels, you may even be asked to hit a shank.</p>
        
        <p>Hitting a shank on purpose, will not make you hit more shanks on the golf course. If you become so skilled at controlling the clubface that you can hit the ball with any part of the club face, you certainly will be able to not hit a shank, when you don't want to. Just as knowing how to make a left turn with a car, will not result in you making a left turn when you don't want to.</p>
        
        
        <h2>Setup view</h2>
        
        <p>The setup view is where you can customize how Swing Skill Builder generates training tasks and where you can start or continue a training session.</p>
        
        <h3>Difficulty Level</h3>
        
        <p>You can choose from four different difficulty levels:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Easy</li>
            <li>Medium</li>
            <li>Hard</li>
            <li>Pro</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Pick Random Golf Club</h3>
        
        <p>When you set <b>Pick Random Golf Club</b> to <b>on</b>, Swing Skill Builder will randomly assign a club to each training task from the clubs selected in <b>Golf Clubs to Use</b>. You can further refine how Swing Skill Builder picks a random club by adjusting the <b>Driver Selection Probability</b> (see below).</p>
        
        <p>If you don't want Swing Skill Builder to assign a random club to each training task, set this to <b>off</b>.</p>
        
        <h3>Golf Clubs to Use</h3>
        
        <p>Here you can select which clubs you want to use in your training session.</p>
        
        <h3>Normal Shot Probability</h3>
        
        <p>This setting determines how often Swing Skill Builder will generate a normal shot training task. A normal shot meaning that you make a normal swing but with a specific intention defined by Swing Skill Builder. For example: "Golf course shot: play the opening shot on a par-5 of your choice".</p>
        
        <p>A value of 1.0 means that only normal shot tasks will be generated. A value of 0.5, means 50 % probability and a value of 0 means that no normal shot tasks will be generated.</p>
        
        <p>The default value is 0.3 meaning 30 &percnt;.</p>
        
        <h3>Driver Selection Probability</h3>
        
        <p>This setting determines how often Swing Skill Builder will pick a driver for the training task (assuming you have <b>Pick Random Golf Club</b> set to <b>on</b> and you have driver selected in <b>Golf Clubs to Use</b>).
        
        <p>A value of 1.0 means that driver will be selected every time. A value of 0.5, means 50 % probability and a value of <b>off</b> (slider at 0) means that a driver will be selected with the same probability as all other clubs you have selected in <b>Golf Clubs to Use</b>.</p>
        
        <p>The default value is 0.3 meaning 30 &percnt;.</p>

        <h3>Starting and continuing a training session</h3>
        
        <p>After you have changed the settings to your liking, hit <b>New Session</b> to begin a training session.</p>
        <p>You may change the settings any time during a training session by going back to the <b>Setup</b> view. You may then continue with your training session by tapping <b>Continue Session</b> (this option is available only when you already have a training session in progress).</p>


        <h2>Training view</h2>
        
        <p>After performing the given task, tap either <b>Fail</b> or <b>Pass</b> according to how you think you succeeded.</p>
        
        <p>According to research, you should strive for a 80-90 &percnt; success rate for optimal learning. Adjust the difficulty level in the <b>Setup</b> view and your own criteria for a passing performance so that your score ends up in around that optimal range.</p>
        
        <p>Your current success rate is displayed at the top. There is no preset number of training tasks in a session. Swing Skill Builder keeps count of the number of passed attempts and the total number of attempts. These are displayed above the current success rate.</p>
        
        <p>While in the <b>Training</b> view, you can swipe left to skip the proposed training task and generate a new one (this will not affect your score or change the number of attempts).</p>
        
        <p>You can repeat the previous training task by swiping right.</p>
        
        <h2>Motor Learning Research and Swing Skill Builder</h2>
        
        <p>Motor learning research has identified three main factors that contribute to optimal learning:</p>
        
        <ol>
            <li>Enhanced expectancies for performance</li>
            <li>Autonomy support</li>
            <li>External focus of attention</li>
        </ol>
        
        <h3>Enhanced expectancies for performance</h3>
        
        <p>Contrary to what our intuition might tell us, getting feedback on good shots leads to faster learning and better retention, than getting an analysis of why a particular shot was bad. According to research on how we actually learn, we should in essence ignore bad shots. So when you are practicing, you should focus on your good shots and ignore the bad ones.</p>
        
        <p>In one study, novice golfers were divided into two groups. One group practiced putting into a large circle around the hole and the other group practiced putting into a smaller circle around the hole. Here again contrary to our intuition, the group that practiced putting into the larger circle performed better than the smaller circle group when they were later tested without the circles. There are several other studies showing that <em>Aim small, miss small</em> produces the opposite result: less accuracy.</p>
        
        <p>When training with Swing Skill Builder you should set easily attainable goals, while still making the practice challenging enough to be interesting. A success rate of 80-90 &percnt; has been shown to be optimal for fastest learning and best retention of the skills learned.</p>
        
        
        <h3>Autonomy support</h3>
        
        <p>Allowing the player to make certain decisions about their practice, has consistently been shown to have beneficial effects on learning when compared to obediently following a preset practice schedule. Even such a seemingly unimportant thing as getting to choose the color of the balls to use in practice, has been shown to have a positive impact on learning. The players that were given some choice over their practice, also completed more sets. So an added benefit is the increased motivation.</p>
        
        <p>Swing Skill Builder lets the player customize how training tasks are produced in many different ways, so that users might benefit from the enhanced learing performance related to autonomy support.</p>
        
        <h3>External focus of attention</h3>
        
        <p>External focus of attention refers to focusing on movement effects outside of the body. An example would be focusing on the logo on the glove instead of the left hand. External focusing leads to greater automaticity and greater movement fluidity. Internal focusing leads to less coordinated inefficient muscular activation. A good external focus in golf is the desired shot shape and landing point.</p>
        
        <p>Swing Skill Builder has both external focus and internal focus oriented training tasks. For optimal results, you should always strive to think of ways to turn an internal focus task into an external focus task. This both trains your creativity and supports your autonomy.</p>

        <p><em>I hope that you have fun using Swing Skill Builder and that it will help you get better at the wonderful game of golf: Seppo Silaste</em></p>
